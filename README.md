# ToolWindow

Provides a mechanism for tool windows in the browser. Tool windows are dialogs which are:
- non-modal
- resizable
- mobile
- closeable
- display content to the user
- have one or more actions the user may perform via buttons in a button bar

Right now, this project needs some documentation. And much refactoring, since the code
originally came from an upstream author with a singular intent (see credits). See the
`demo/index.html` file for some in-browser usage. 

# Usage
Use this as a node module via `require` or use this as a standalone javascript file 
by grabbing the toolwindow.js from `dist`. The provided `toolwindow.css` mimicks the 
styling of a Windows 10 window. If you'd like something else, feel free to use that 
as a template (:

# Tests:
Visual only. Contributions welcome.
